# StockPortfolio-Optimization-ML

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing a stock portfolio of major technology companies using statistical methods and machine learning. The primary objective is to maximize returns while controlling risk, based on historical stock data.

## Project Overview
- Analyzed 10 years of historical data for TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, META, and AMZN.
- Assessed returns, volatility, maximum drawdown, and stock correlations.
- Applied Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization to construct the optimal portfolio.
- Evaluated key metrics including Sharpe Ratio, annualized returns, and volatility.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
- The optimized portfolio achieved an annual return of approximately 32% with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.12.
- TSLA, AAPL, and META emerged as key components due to their growth potential and diversification benefits.
- The portfolio effectively balanced risk and return across selected assets.

## My Contribution
- Collected and preprocessed financial data.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Developed and implemented the portfolio optimization model.
- Interpreted and visualized the results.

## Future Work
- Integrating deep learning models for forecasting.
- Expanding the strategy to include real-time rebalancing.
- Applying the methodology to broader markets and asset classes.
